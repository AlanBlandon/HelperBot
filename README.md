# HelperBot
 An entry level Discord bot that is highly customizable and allows for custom made commands.

Description:
This bot allows the user to customize and custom make any commands that the specific user wishes for. 
There are some basic commands that I found amusing and useful in my Discord servers.

Then invite the bot to your server by cliking the link and allowing the bot into the server of your choice.

After, open a command console in the root directory of the project files and launch the bot by typing the command "node ." in the console. 
The bot will greet you with a "HelperBot is ready for action!" in the console to let you know it's running and ready to go. 

You can start using the bot by issuing the "~commands" command in your Discord server to view a list of the currently available commands.
