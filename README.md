# HelperBot
 An entry level Discord bot that is highly customizable and allows for custom made commands.

Description:
This bot allows the user to customize and custom make any commands that the specific user wishes for. 
There are some basic commands that I found amusing and useful in my Discord servers.

After, open a command console in the root directory of the project files and launch the bot by typing the command "node ." in the console.
